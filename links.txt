Note: I wanna do the pixel art generation stuff at some point with a crdt system as the baseline so people can draw together and then tap to get generative creations

Note again: I'm tired and wanna do some sort of vector encoding comparisons when I have time, might as well use real analysis 2 at some point

Another note: no idea why, but I feel awful on 10_20_23. I think I'm sick with something really bad? Not sure but it's odd, may check back in here at some point

update 10_21_23, I feel much better!
